  QUICK START GUIDE - CirrusLine Billing Reports
================================================================================

WHAT THIS DOES:
---------------
Generates billing reports from your monthly Vitelity and SkySwitch CDR data,
including:
  - Call ratio (Interstate vs Intrastate %)
  - CDR breakdown by customer
  - Combined SkySwitch + Vitelity report
  - Phone number counts
  - Seat counts
  - SMS usage


SETUP (ONE TIME):
-----------------
1. Make sure Python 3.9+ is installed
   - Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - During install, CHECK "Add Python to PATH"

2. Put these files in a folder (e.g., C:\Billing):
   - billing_reports.py
   - call_ratio.py
   - run_billing.bat


MONTHLY USAGE:
--------------
1. Download your monthly reports into a folder, e.g.:
   "Working Reports 2025_11"

   Files needed:
   - http-XXXXXX.csv          (Vitelity CDR)
   - phonenumbers__XXXXX.csv  (Phone number mapping)
   - syneteks-XXXX.csv        (SMS - optional)
   - Domain-Statistics-XXXX.xlsx (Seat counts - optional)
   - CDR SS records-XX_XX.xlsx   (Master Excel - optional, for combined report)

2. Double-click run_billing.bat

3. If prompted, enter the path to your reports folder:
   Example: C:\Users\Dean\Desktop\Working Reports 2025_11

4. Reports are saved to the "reports" folder


OUTPUT FILES:
-------------
  cdr_by_customer.csv           - Vitelity CDR by customer with call ratios
  combined_cdr_by_customer.csv  - Combined SkySwitch + Vitelity (if master xlsx provided)
  phone_counts_by_customer.csv  - BILLABLE phone numbers per customer
  phone_excluded_invother.csv   - Non-billable phones (fax, on-hold, unassigned)
  seat_counts_by_customer.csv   - PBX seats per customer
  sms_by_customer.csv           - SMS usage per customer
  callerid_counts.csv           - CallerID lookup counts

NOTE: Phone counts automatically exclude fax machines, on-hold numbers, and
unassigned numbers. These are saved to phone_excluded_invother.csv for reference.


THE KEY NUMBER:
---------------
Look for "OVERALL CALL RATIO" or "COMBINED CALL RATIO" in the output:

  +---------------------------------------+
  |  COMBINED CALL RATIO                  |
  +---------------------------------------+
  |  Interstate:   40.17%                 |  <-- This is what you need
  |  Intrastate:   59.83%                 |
  +---------------------------------------+

FCC Safe Harbor: 64.9% interstate / 35.1% intrastate


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
- "Python not found": Install Python and make sure to check "Add to PATH"
- "File not found": Check file names match patterns (http-*.csv, etc.)
- Wrong folder: Drag and drop folder onto run_billing.bat, or specify path
